    "Let us consider a classical theory of scattering, specifically we have a potential fixed in space that falls off far from the origin and we imagine a large number of particles incident upon this from a large distance.  By examining the trajectories of the particles well after the scattering \"event\" we would try to reconstruct what happened.  Rather than use our \"scattering formalism\", developed in class, let us consider this to be a problem involving integrating the equations of motion for many particles in a potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our lives just a little easier, let us assume $m_1/m_2\\to 0$, so that the lab frame and the COM frame are coincident and we can treat the scattering potential as \"fixed\" in space.  We will also work throughout in the $z=0$ plane, so this is effectively a 2D problem.  Both of these simplifications can be relaxed if needed."
